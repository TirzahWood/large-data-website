# Overall Comparisons

Overall style tile 1 has more of the supernatural beings feel to it and will probably work better with the subject matter.

Overall style tile 1 has an "underwater" feel that is suitable to the subject matter. Element Collage 2 will probably be appealing to children because of its fun graphics and bright colours. And lastly, type Guide 3 has a simple easy to understand look that will help people who just want the bare minimum information and nothing else. 

I will go with style one because it makes the most sense with the content.
