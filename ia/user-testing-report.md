## Individual Results & Observations

### Jenny Richardson

- Easy and no scrolling 
- Second task had some trouble finding articles
- Third task was also easy

## Trends

### Critical, Needs Fixing, Unable to Complete

- There was nothing critically wrong with the website just minor communication problems


### Serious, Causes Frustration, May Hinder Completion

- There was no real serious frustrations that I feel need to be fixed right away just some things that I might have to consider to make it easier to navigate through.


### Minor, Annoying, Wonâ€™t Hinder Completion

- Two of the participants had some trouble find the article page, I fell that it might have been to the way that I worded the question. or maybe I need to fix the nav so that it makes more sense
