## Observations

- Comments that were made by particapents were all asking what some of things were that were written on the cards

- There were no questions that stood out.

- Kathryn had some issue with sorting the name of the creature she wondered if she should the creatures under catagories or just put them all under the same catagory.

- The grouping from both participant was almost the same.

- I was not exspecting the cards Angels, Demons, and were wols to be put under what are supernatural beings.

- The results were similar to my exspectations.

- While watching the card sort I felt interested as to what the results would be.
