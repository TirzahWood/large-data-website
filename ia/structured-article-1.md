Subtitle: Starter sentence about angels.

---

An angel from the Greek ἄγγελος - ángelos is a supernatural being or spirit, usually in humanoid form, found in various religions and mythologies.

The theological study of angels is known as "angelology". In Zoroastrianism and Abrahamic religions they are often depicted as benevolent celestial beings who act as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits or a guiding influence.

The term "angel" has also been expanded to various notions of spirits found in many other religious traditions. Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings, and carrying out God's tasks.
